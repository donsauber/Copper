## **Project Status Logs**

**Project Status Logs** are Copper files that store the *current, authoritative version* of a project’s information.  They are the **active memory layer** for both humans and AIs — always up to date, always minimal.

These logs are *not* archives or transcripts. They are the stripped-down, truth-of-now snapshots that AIs reread on startup to rebuild context.

---

### **Purpose**

* Maintain the present state of each system or subject.

* Let AIs reload accurate context without digging through Dia-Logs or chat history.

* Prevent memory bloat by keeping only valid, current information.

* Serve as the single source of truth for what is real *right now.*

---

### **Behavior**

* **Replace, don’t append.** When something changes, old data is removed or rewritten.

* **Keep it lean.** No commentary, no obsolete notes — just verified current facts.

* **Autonomous upkeep.** Agents detect changes in Dia-Logs and update the Status Logs automatically.

* **Cross-checked.** When a value changes, connected logs are updated for consistency.

* **Version control handles history.** Git keeps the old versions if needed; the file itself stays clean.

### **Format**

Copper’s flat structure makes them easy to read and rewrite:

`[=SMARTd20 Attribute System=]`

`project: SMARTd20`

`version: 1.2`

`updated: 2025-10-27`

`Primary Attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, Willpower`

`Secondary Attributes: Perception, Charm, Fortitude`

`Skill Links:`

  `Strength → Melee, Athletics`

  `Agility → Stealth, Acrobatics`

  `Intellect → Science, Computers`

  `Willpower → Resolve, Magic Control`

No comments, timestamps, or discussions — just the current state.  
 Agents update, humans review.

---

### **Workflow**

1. **Change happens** — in a Dia-Log or chat.

2. **An agent detects it** and opens the relevant Status Log.

3. **Outdated data is replaced** with the new version.

4. **Linked Status Logs** are updated for consistency.

5. **Commit occurs automatically**; Git retains the diff for record-keeping.

At any given time, the Project Status Logs collectively describe *the entire system as it exists now.*

---

### **Guidelines**

* One Status Log per major system or module.

* Keep formatting consistent so agents can parse easily.

* Never include deprecated or speculative notes.

* All descriptive commentary belongs in Dia-Logs.

* Treat the Status Logs as the AI’s **active workspace**, not its diary.

---

### **Why They Matter**

* **Memory efficiency:** AIs don’t need massive long-term storage; they rebuild state from these files.

* **Synchronization:** Humans and AIs share the same factual baseline.

* **Speed:** Parsing a few clean files is faster than scanning whole histories.

* **Clarity:** You always know where the “real” information lives.
